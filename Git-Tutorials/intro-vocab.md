#Intro Tutorial to Git and Github

#Summary

Github is a website that is used to store repositories, where users can 
collaborate on projects together. It creates an interface with a variety of
different useful features for building projects. 

Git is used within the terminal, whether that be an stand alone application
like "git bash." On a Mac, the default app for this functionality is called 
"terminal" and on Windows it is called the "powershell."

You can use whichever you prefer, or even just use the terminal within 
VSCODE which is probably far easier considering you can perform all of your 
changes within one app.

#Branches

Each repo has a default branch, one we typically deem "main."

It's good practice not to write directly to this branch, because if something
breaks, it breaks the main default branch of our repo. Although right now 
that doesn't seem like a big deal, it can actually cause a variety of
problems. Later on down the line, if the site has consistent users, breaking
the main branch will break the functionality for the users as well. It also
causes problems for collaborators of the repo.

So to be safe, whenever we make changes it's best to create a separate 
branch to host these changes.
